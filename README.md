My History App

The historical figures app is designed to provide users with information about famous historical figures based on their entered age. It offers an engaging and educational experience by presenting users with famous people who achieved remarkable accomplishments at various stages of their lives. Sparking curiosity and inspiring users by showcasing the achievements of prominent figures is the purpose of this app(Open AI 2024). Serving as an educational tool is the primary purpose of the app, informing users of the historical figures’ achievements as well as insight into their lives. By demonstrating that age is not a barrier to success, it will inspire and motivate the user.  By introducing users to figures from different countries and time periods, I believe it could promote historical awareness. The reason why history is important is because is plays a vital role in preserving and transmitting cultural heritage, traditions, and identities from one generation to another.

The app contains a simplistic user interface designed for easy interaction. The code is structured in a clear and organized manner, following best practices for android development. This is done by not overcomplicating the user interface and only showing a simple instruction which is the statement “Enter Age”. There is a button which will give the user an idea of what will happen when their age is inputted as well a clear button for clearing the previous information.  There are pictures of a map which were taken from google, I chose that design because it gives a historical theme to the app.  The way it works is the user inters their age, once entered he/she can press the generate history button which will display information about the historical figure corresponding to the entered age. It also has clear button next to the generate history button which rets the displayed information if the user wishes to change the number. This application I have created includes error handling mechanisms to handle cases where users provide invalid or incomplete input. 
For future implementation I wish to create an expandable database to include a broader range of historical figures from different cultures and time periods. I also want it to be more personalized, instead of each age group receiving one historical figure, I want the user to receive at least three different outcomes when they enter their age. I should probably add a variety of information such as audio clips and images of the famous historical figure because I know that could enhance user engagement. It would also be cool if it could create an interactive timeline feature that allows any user to explore any historical figure chronologically. In other words, the user can learn about significant events and individuals from ear by navigating through different time periods of their lives. The app should be accessible to users from diverse linguistics backgrounds by providing a multi-language support system. A great feature that could be added is recommending historical figures and events tailored to each users interests, increasing engagement and relevance (OpenAI, 2024).

The code within the app takes an age as an input and then displays information about a historical figure associated with that age range. For this section I am going to give a breakdown of the code in my application. Inside “MainActivity” class, there is a variable called “historicFigures”  and a mapOf function that associates ages with pairs of historic figure names and provides information about them. According to tutorialspoint “Kotlin map is a collection of key/value pairs, where each key is unique, and it can only be associated with multiple keys though. We can declare the keys and values to be any type; there are no restrictions. Therefore, a Kotlin map can either be mutable (mutableMapOf) or read-only (mapOf) References to the user interface elements such as buttons, text views and an edit text field are obtained using the “findViewById”. The two click listeners are set for the “Generate History” button and the “Clear” button. When the “Generate History" button is clicked, the text entered in the “ageEditText” field is retrieved. If the field is not empty, the age is extracted and passed to the “findHistoricFigure” function to retrieve the corresponding historic figure information, which is then displayed in the “infoTextView”. If the age field is empty, a message prompts the user to enter their age. When the clear button is clicked the text in the “infoTextView” is cleared and the text in the “ageEditText” field is also cleared. This code provides a simple Android app that allows users to input their age and see information about a historic figure associated with that range. I also uploaded a video detailing not only the purpose of the app, but also displaying the basic functionality and how the interaction between the user and the application will be beneficial and informative. In addition, it gives the potential user an idea of what he/she can expect when opening and using the software by showing the outcome of the user input.

Kevin Stratvert (2022) states that GitHub is a hosting platform where you can collaborate with others on your git repositories. Git is an open source and free source control management or what is referred to as “source control management”. You can use github to track your projects as well as rectify any mistakes from fixing a typo to completely redesigning the project. Github is basically a social coding website like Instagram or Facebook. Once you have created an account on github you can create a cloud repository which you can then add your project to github to share with either the whole community or a select amount of people. The application provides features that caters to the needs of the user, whether its about potential bugs within your app or possible improvements which could make your designs more interactive and appealing to the target audience. Anyone with a github account can access other people”s repositories and provide their perspective on the code by changing the code and merging their work with the other users project, this is good as it can increase productivity as well as increase overall quality of the product by means of collaboration. Developers can track changes, manage branches, and work on features or fixes in a controlled environment. GitHub Actions are utilized for continuous intergration and deployment to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Workflows are set to trigger actions like building the app, running tests, and deploying the app stores or Version control with GitHub provides a history of changes, facilitates code reviews, and enables rollbacks if needed.
